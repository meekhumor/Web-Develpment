# React

1. Go to folders's path (cd)
2. `npm create vite@latest`
3. `npm install`
4. `npm run dev`
5. Delete `App.css` and `index.css` in src folder
6. Tailwind: Go to `docs->framework guide->Vite`
    - You have to use `className` instead of `class` for tailwind
    - You need to close every tag <img/>, etc

7. Make `component` folder in src [reusability]
    - You can create jsx files in it and use them again and again
    - `rfce` for boilerplate
