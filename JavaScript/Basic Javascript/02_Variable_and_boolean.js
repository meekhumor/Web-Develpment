// Basic Syntax: let someName = value;
let year = 1987;
year += 5; // (adds 5 to year)
year++; // (add 1 to year) (post increment)

// const works just like let, except you cannot change the value (you cannot increment it) 
const pi = 3.14 

// var is also a variable                                       
var Distance = 5

// true and false are boolean 
let isGameOver = true; // (you can change this to number)
