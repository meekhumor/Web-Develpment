// string doesn't alter after making changes to index whereas array does 

// Arrays in js works on the principle of references and hence if equality is checked between two arrays which contains same data , then the wequality 
// turns out to be false . this is due to the fact that their references are different, if equality comes out to true they are the same reference arrays
// (identical) this can be thought similar to a arrow pointing a certainÂ location.

// Though const is used in array, the values can change as long as reference remains same  
// We can use array methods but can't change array

// Nested Arrays
