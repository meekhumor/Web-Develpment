// Databases can handle large amounts of data efficiently and store it compactly
//  - They provide tools for easy insertion,querying, and updating of data
//  - They generally offer security features and control over access to data
//  - They (generally) scale well.

// Structured Query Language (SQL) Database:
// A relational databases which re-define a schema of tables before we insert anything.

// No SQL Database:
// NoSQL databases do not use SQL. There are many types of no-sql databases, including document, key-value, and graph stores.

//  - It's easy to get started with (though it can be tricky to truly master)
//  - It plays particularly well with JavaScript
//  - Its popularity also means there is a strong community of developers using Mongo.
