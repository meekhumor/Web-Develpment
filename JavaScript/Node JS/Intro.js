// Node - a javascript runtime.
//   Node. js provides a runtime environment outside of the browser. 
//   It's also built on the Chrome V8 JavaScript engine. 
//   This makes it possible to build back-end applications using the same JavaScript programming language you may be familiar with 
  
  
//   What do people build with node ?
//   - web serves 
//   - command line tools 
//   - native apps (vs code is a node app!)
//   - video games 
//   - drone software 
//   - a whole lot more!
