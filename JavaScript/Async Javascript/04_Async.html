<!-- 
  Async JavaScript (often referred to as asynchronous JavaScript) is different
  from normal JavaScript in how it handles operations that take time to complete,
  such as fetching data from a server, reading a file, or waiting for user input.

  In normal JavaScript execution, operations are performed synchronously, meaning
  that each operation is completed before moving on to the next one. This can lead
  to blocking behavior, where the entire program waits for a single operation to
  finish before continuing execution.
  
  Async JavaScript, on the other hand, allows
  multiple operations to be performed concurrently, without waiting for each one
  to finish before moving on to the next. This is achieved through mechanisms such
  as callbacks, promises, and async/await. -->
